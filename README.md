# donewiththisworld

Hey my name is david vasquez.... personally I find myself learning new technology quite naturally. Noone pushes me to write this or even think about starting something like this. I must admit I have always been a techie at heart. If you were to ask me what OS I prefer... I'd say neither.. I adapt and am great at both. I am not self taught.... I do not believe in this ideology. While I didn't go to school for this stuff I learned by reading from other people that came before me. I take no credit besides putting in the effort to learn.....


You'll find out more about me in the near future I promise. This world is changing fast. It's not waiting for anyone.... So here's my little secret. I grow my own food, and I am in the rabbits hole.

Best,
Sunidaze
